3. Add a form so that users can create their own mondrian based on # of columns, # of rows, and sizes for each. 

4. Add a database structure that easily handles custom mondrians.  Will probably need to add a row or column class that 
    can store that specific row/column's save data as well as the height/width of the rows and columns.

6. Create a script that combines like colors sitting next to each other into one larger square.  Recolor the border maybe?

7. Create a gallery of other's mondrians that are viewable but not editable.
